# Supply Chain Tracking System using Blockchain technology

This box has all you need to get started with our Supply Chain Tracking System
## Installation

1. Install Truffle globally.
    ```javascript
    npm install -g truffle
    ```

2. Clone the repo or download it. This also takes care of installing the necessary dependencies.
    ```javascript
    git clone "the link on the right top side of the webside"
    ```


3. Compile and migrate the smart contracts, then run the test
    ```javascript
    truffle migrate
    truffle test
    ```

5. Run the `liteserver` development server (outside the development console) for front-end hot reloading. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    // Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000
    npm run dev
    ```
